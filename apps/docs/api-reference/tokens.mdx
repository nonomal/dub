API keys on Dub.co allow other apps to access your workspace programmatically. This is useful for integrating Dub with other tools and services.

Each API key is tied to a specific workspace – meaning you can use it to access that workspace's resources without having to worry about "leaking" access to other workspaces. You also no longer need to pass your [workspace ID](https://dub.co/help/article/how-to-get-workspace-id) in your API requests.

<Tip>Dub API keys are prefixed with `dub_` for easy identification.</Tip>

## API key permissions

You can create 3 types of API keys on Dub.co:

1. **All permissions** – This API key will have full access to all resources.
2. **Read only** – This API key will have read-only access to all resources.
3. **Restricted** – This API key will have restricted access to some resources:
   - [Links](/data-model#links)
   - [Analytics](/api-reference/endpoint/retrieve-analytics)
   - [Workspaces](/data-model#workspace)
   - [Domains](/data-model#domains)
   - [Tags](/data-model#tags)
   - API Keys

Depending on your use case, you might want to use one of these 3 options to limit the scope of the API key and improve security.

## Machine users

On Dub, you can create API keys that are associated with a "Machine user". This is particularly helpful when you don't want to associate the API key with a particular user in your workspace, to avoid security risks in involving turnover or changes in project ownership.

</Frame>

These machine users will show up on your workspace's **People** tab, but will not contribute to your workspace's user count.

  />
</Frame>

<Tip>
  If you delete an API key associated with a machine user, the machine user will
  be deleted. Vice versa, if you delete a machine user, their corresponding API
  key will be deleted as well.

## How to create an API key

You can create an API key by following these steps:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Go to your workspace">
    Go to **Settings** > **API Keys** in your workspace.

    <Frame>
      <img
        src="/images/workspace-api-keys.png"
        alt="Workspace API keys on Dub"
        width="1468"
        height="249"
      />
    </Frame>

  </Step>
  <Step title="Create an API Key">
    Click on the "Create" button and select permissions you want to grant to
    the API key.

    Select between "You" and "Machine" to associate the API key with a user or a [machine user](#machine-users).

    - **You** – This API key is tied to your user and can make requests against the selected workspace.
    - **Machine** – A machine user will be added to your workspace, and an API key will be created.

    <Frame>
      <img
        src="/images/add-new-api-key.png"
        alt="Add new API key on Dub"
        width="1468"
        height="249"
      />
    </Frame>

    When making API calls, if your API Key have insufficient permissions, the error should tell you which permissions you need.

    Make sure to copy your API key and store it in a safe place. You won't be able to see it again.

  </Step>
  <Step title="Use your API Key">
    Now that you have your API key, you can use it to access your workspace's resources programmatically via SDKs or within any API request as a bearer token.

    ```
    Authorization: Bearer dub_xxxx
    ```

  </Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
  We recommend creating API keys with the least privilege necessary to perform
  the required tasks. This helps to reduce the risk of unauthorized access to
  your workspace.
