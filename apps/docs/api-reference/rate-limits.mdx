Dub's API rate limiting is in conformance with the [IETF standard](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-ietf-httpapi-ratelimit-headers):

| Header Name             | Description                                                                     |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `X-RateLimit-Limit`     | The maximum number of requests that the consumer is permitted to make per hour. |
| `X-RateLimit-Remaining` | The number of requests remaining in the current rate limit window.              |
| `X-RateLimit-Reset`     | The time at which the current rate limit window resets in UTC epoch seconds.    |
| `Retry-After`           | The number of seconds to wait before retrying the request again.                |

Dub's API is capped at **600 requests per minute** per key on the Free plan, with elevated limits for [Pro plan](https://dub.co/help/article/pro-plan) and above.

This is implemented to ensure a fair usage policy so that excessive use by a single user does not adversely affect the performance and usage of the API by others.

You'll receive a `429 Too Many Requests` response code if the rate limit is exceeded.

## Rate limits by plan
